    /*Generate the HTML for a link that opens in a separate browser tab. The attribute values of the link should be in double quotes. Generate the link 2 different ways. First, use double quoted strings with embedded double quotes, then use single quoted strings with embedded double quotes.

    Now use arrays each with a handful of elements and loop through the arrays to generate links to multiple pages. Do the same to generate multiple images.

    Then ditch the arrays and generate links to pages of the form folder-xx/page-yy.html where xx is 10 - 14 and yy is 01 - 05. So the first href would be folder-10/page-01.html.

    Do the same with images where each image is of the form images-xx/img-yy.jpg where xx is 55 - 59 and yy is 100 - 104. So the first image would be images-55/img-100.jpg.*/

    var answer1 = '';
    var answer2 = '';
    var xx = 55;
    var yy = 100;

    for (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
        answer1 += '<img src="images-' + xx++ + '/img-' + yy++ + '.jpg" alt="img-' + i + '"><br>';
    };
    console.log(answer1);
    document.getElementById("answer-1").innerHTML = answer1;


    for (var x = 6; x < 11; x++) {
        answer2 += "<img src=\"images-" + xx++ + "/img-" + yy++ + ".jpg\" alt=\"img-" + x + "\"><br>";
    };
    console.log(answer2);
    document.getElementById("answer-2").innerHTML = answer2;
